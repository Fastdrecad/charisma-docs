## 📉 Downside Scenarios (What Could Go Wrong)

### Scenario 1: Poor User Adoption

**Risk:** <100 users after 3 months  
**Impact:** Valuation drops to $400K-$500K  
**Mitigation:** Iterate quickly, pivot if needed, focus on retention

### Scenario 2: High AI Costs

**Risk:** AI costs >$2/user/month (margins squeezed)  
**Impact:** Need to increase prices or reduce features  
**Mitigation:** Already have cost tracking + rate limiting + multi-provider fallback

### Scenario 3: Competitor Launch

**Risk:** Tinder/Bumble launch AI coach feature  
**Impact:** Market gets harder, need to differentiate more  
**Mitigation:** Build moat with RAG system, focus on quality

### Scenario 4: Team Scaling Issues

**Risk:** Can't hire fast enough, solo founder burnout  
**Impact:** Delays in execution, missed milestones  
**Mitigation:** Hire after beta, build advisor network

# 🔍 Key Differences from Original Report

## Original Report Said:

- ✅ Valuation: $600K - $1.5M (too wide)
- ❌ Timeline: 4-8 weeks to $1M+ (unrealistic)
- ❌ Post-launch: $1M - $3M (too optimistic)
- ❌ Investment readiness: 90% (ignores traction gap)

## This Revised One-Pager Says:

- ✅ Valuation: $600K - $800K (tight, realistic)
- ✅ Timeline: 12 weeks to fundraise-ready (realistic)
- ✅ Post-launch: $1M - $1.5M in 6 months (achievable)
- ✅ Investment readiness: 85% tech, 0% traction = 50% overall

## Why This is Better:

1. **Honest about weaknesses** (no users, solo founder)
2. **Realistic timelines** (12 weeks not 4-8)
3. **Conservative projections** (easier to beat than miss)
4. **Clear use of funds** (investors want specifics)
5. **Risk/reward transparent** (shows you understand the game)

---

**Use this one-pager for investor meetings.** It shows maturity, realism, and understanding of startup dynamics. Investors respect founders who are honest about risks more than founders who overpromise.
